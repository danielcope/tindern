Hello!

This is a fun project that I am working on. It's a Tinder clone with a Dungeons and Dragons twist.

I'm using React Native, Expo CLI, Android Studio, React Native Navigation, React Native Flux, Redux, and a few other smaller modules.

If you want to see the current progress of the application download Expo Go on your phone, go to this link https://expo.dev/@danielacope/dnd-tinder, and scan the QR code with Expo Go.
